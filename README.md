📄 PDF report generation using Jinja2 + HTML + `wkhtmltopdf`

📧 Auto-emailing personalized reports to form submitters

🌐 Flask-based web app hosted on Render

🔐 Secure config via environment variables and service account management


**Project Structure:**

grc_scoring.py  (scoring, PDF generation, email generation)

scoring_config.json (Scoring rules per question/domain)

report_template.html (HTML report template for Jinja2)

requirements.txt (Python dependencies)

service_account.json ( see the steps below to obtain this)

README.md 

**Prerequisites:**

Google Form connected to a Google Sheet

Service account with Sheets API access

Google Sheet share access to the service account email

Gmail App Password (for sending email)

scoring_config.json aligned with your Form questions

Render.com account for hosting (or local setup)

**Local Installation:**

1.Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/rohitharavinth/CTRL-GRC.git
cd CTRL-GRC


2.Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3.Install wkhtmltopdf:

Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install wkhtmltopdf
Windows: Download from https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html and Add to your system PATH.


4.service_account.json creation 

Step 1: Go to Google Cloud Console > Sign in with your Gmail account. > Create a new Google Cloud Project (or use an existing one).


Step 2: Enable Google Sheets API > In the left sidebar, go to APIs & Services → Library. > Search for Google Sheets API. > Click Enable.


Step 3: Create a Service Account > Go to IAM & Admin → Service Accounts. > Click “Create Service Account”.


Name: ctrl-grc-sheets-access (or anything) > Description: For accessing Google Sheets from Python


Click Create and Continue.


Step 4: Grant Permissions > In the "Grant this service account access to project" screen:


Role: Choose Editor (you can later restrict this further to just "Viewer").


Click Done.

Step 5: Generate Service Account JSON Key > Go back to IAM & Admin → Service Accounts.


Click on the service account you just created. > Go to the "Keys" tab. > Click "Add Key" → "Create new key". > Select JSON format. > Click Create.


A .json file will download automatically — this is your service_account.json file.


Step 6: Share Your Google Sheet with the Service Account


Open your linked Google Sheet and Click “Share”. > Add the service account email (it looks like: your-service-name@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com).


Give it Viewer access (or Editor if needed).


Save.


Step 7 Final Tips: 

Rename the downloaded file to service_account.json.


In your Python project, place it in a safe path or secure folder.


For Render.com:(optional)

Go to Secrets → upload it.

Mount it to /etc/secrets/service_account.json.

Then in your Python file change: 

SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = "/etc/secrets/service_account.json"


5. Email id and password integration in your python code

Set environment variables (for Gmail sender): change the email and password

export EMAIL_USER="your_email@gmail.com"
export EMAIL_PASS="your_app_password"

password should be app based password which can be generated in google accounts.

6.Run python grc_scoring.py

7. Optional: Google Apps Script Trigger
To trigger your /generate endpoint from Google Form:


function onFormSubmit(e) {
  var options = {
    "muteHttpExceptions": true
  };
  UrlFetchApp.fetch("https://ctrl-grc.onrender.com/generate", options);
}

Attach this to your Form's "On form submit" trigger.

8.  Sample Report

The generated PDF includes:

Overall security score and percentage
Domain-wise score breakdown
Executive summary
Recommendations with priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

9. Troubleshooting

❌ 404 on /generate: Check app.py for correct route method and deployment.
❌ Invalid JWT: Make sure the service account JSON is valid and has Sheet access.
❌ Email not sending: Ensure app password is valid, and sender email is not blocked.
